            <h1>What is HTML ?</h1>
            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language which helps structured elements 
                so that the browsers can display their contents according to the formats 
                given. A numbered list would consist of a “ol” tag which stands for ordered list. 
                This would allow the list to be in numerical order. The “ul” tag would put the 
                list in dot format with no order to the list.</p>
                <br>
            <p>In HTML elements carries an end tag for most of the time. Let us say we are 
                creating a paragraph tag, you would start off with a “p” and carry on what 
                you would like to write in the paragraph. To end the paragraph tag you would 
                need to input “/p>”,the backslash would represent the closing tag followed by the starting tag.</p>

            <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
            <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheet. It is an important part of web design without 
                it a website would be a bland black and white page with no font diversity.Commenting 
                is one of the most important part of programming, it helps indicate what your code means
                 to others who are viewing or working with your code.To comment in CSS you would need to 
                 use the /* (type your comment here) and end with a */ tag to close the comment.</p>
                 <br>
            <p>Have you ever have the need to zoom in to a webpage you are viewing as the fonts are small? 
                Well have no worries the control text size would allow you to customize the fonts of your website
                 to increase or decrease the font size by using the “ text-size: “ command combined with the pixel
                  size you desire in the css script.If your would like to change the color of the font you would need 
                  to declare the element name.Lets say we would like to change the heading one font color which is in
                   the “h3 element.We would first put a dot and the element tag name followed by a pair of open curly
                    braces,you would input your code inside the curly braces.The final code would be 
                    “ .h3{color: purple}; “ as a common practice you would always end your css code with a ; to 
                    indicate the next line of code.</p>
